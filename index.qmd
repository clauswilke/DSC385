You can install all required R packages at once by running the following code in the R command line:

```r
# first run this command:
install.packages(
  c(
    "broom", "cluster", "colorspace", "cowplot", "gapminder", 
    "GGally", "gganimate", "ggiraph", "ggdendro", "ggdist", "ggforce",
    "ggplot2movies", "ggrepel", "ggridges", "ggthemes", "gifski", "glue",
    "knitr", "learnr", "naniar", "margins", "MASS", "Matrix",
    "nycflights13", "palmerpenguins", "patchwork", "quarto", "rmarkdown",
    "rnaturalearth", "Rtsne", "scales", "sf", "sp", "tidyverse",
    "transformr", "umap"
  )
)

# then run this command:
install.packages(
  "rnaturalearthhires", repos = "https://packages.ropensci.org", type = "source"
)
```
